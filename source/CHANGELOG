1. data preparation:
    a. instead of specifying number per category/phenomenon, now it's also possible to specify percentage.
    b. by exporting, the generated sentences will be scrambled using the wiki sentences provided by Vivien. Scrambling method is originally developed by Jan in python, I reimplemented it in scala to store scrambling keys directly in database, so that unscrambling is more straightforward.
    c. scrambling factor can be adapted, currently ranged from 2 to 10, meaning for 1 choose sentence, 2 to 10 wiki sentences will be inserted to the list.
    
2. upload report:
    a. file format changed to list of sentences instead of previously list of (ID,Source,Target). 
    b. by uploading, also need to specify engine name, language direction, engine type (can be multiple), comment, and also the template id, which is key for unscrambling, if the uploaded file name contains number, it will be extracted and used as key. If the key is inferred wrong or the file name does not contain number, the template id has to be given manually.
    c. by clicking upload, the list will be unscrambled automatically using the template id.
    
3. view report:
    a. reports can be filtered either by comment, or by combination of engine+type+language, after filtering, choose date+time to show single reports.
    b. add filter to each column of the report table. Note: this causes lag in long reports
    c. removed columns Positive/Negative Regex/Tokens, instead, the positive/negative regex/tokens are shown in a new view triggered by clicking the eye button in front of a row, or clicking on the whole row. From there you can modify the regex and tokens and the translation will be automatically validated (regex has priority than token). The modification can be applied to database or discarded by click the bottom buttons.
    d. adding comment to single record is also possible by clicking the last cell in the row.
    e. add new table for statistics, in the same format used in paper.
    
4. compare reports: (new)
    a. choose engines to compare based on the common templates of reports they are tested with. I doubt if it's practical to compare reports from different templates (i.e. different sentence set), since the categories and phenomena are different and the result table will look very frastrated.
    b. after clicking compare, a table will be shown in the same format as in paper.
